// Given the variables num1 and num2, write some code to evaluate the following:
// If num1 is less than num2, print to the console, "<num1> is less than <num2>"
// If num1 is greater than num2, print to the console, "<num1> is greater than <num2>"
// If num1 is equal to num2, print to the console, "These numbers are equal"
// Bonus: If either num1 or num2 is not a valid Number data type, print to the console, "Whoa, those aren't numbers!"
