/*
Write a for-loop that will iterate the array of Numbers, nums, and determine if each number is even or odd. If it is even, increment the evenCount variable by 1, and if it is odd, increment the oddCount variable by 1.

ex:
const nums = [2, 4, 5, 25, -2, 11, 100]
console.log(evenCount) --> 4
console.log(oddCount) --> 3
*/

const nums = [2, 4, 5, 25, -2, 11, 100]
let evenCount = 0
let oddCount = 0

// YOUR CODE HERE:


console.log("evenCount", evenCount)
console.log("oddCount", oddCount)
